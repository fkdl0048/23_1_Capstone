Licenses
========================

If you want to use these assets on a commercial project, then a commercial license is needed, you may purchase one at the asset store you acquire this pack. 
The cost of the pack will be displayed there (usually 3.99$)

By buying a commercial license you are helping me continue to develop more packs for the Smallburg world.

Thank you for supporting me and Smallburg, it means a lot.


Commercial License
========================

By using the commercial license you are allowed to use this pack on any commercial project you desire, any number of times. 
One license for several commercial projects.
A license usually costs $3.99, but prices can change on the store. The store price is the ruling one.
You are allowed to edit the assets, for any commercial usage.

You cannot redistribute or re-sell any of the assets of this pack. 

Credit is not required but appreciated.
If you use this asset pack on several different projects, it would be great if you buy one extra license for each new commercial project, but that is not required, just highly appreciated.
A link to your work would be appreciated as well.
