Instructions
========================

There are two items here, the stall and the building.


Stall (both versions)
-------------
This is a one piece item 128x128 pixels size. 
This item has two states:
1. Opened Shop
2. Closed Shop

You can put NPCs always behind the stall if you want, since the stall has transparency it will appear properly.

Building (paid version)
-------------
This is a one piece item 128x128 pixels size. Although it uses the housing items, I added some extra flair to it.

This item has two states:
1. Opened Shop
2. Closed Shop

In the first state the background of the window was separated from the shop so you can add any 
NPC in the background. 
The middle item of the PNG is the background for the window shop.

If you are using layers in you game:

1. Add the background layer
2. Add the NPC
3. Add the shop
