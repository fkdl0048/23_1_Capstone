So panels! How to explain this... Imagine windows INSIDE of windows?
Panels are for that, to have subdivision inside of window panes.

There are regular panels and vertical/horizontal panels that change between colors.
So panels are 16x16, but can be used as 8x8 if you want although some panels might not work.

Each panel is a 9 item division. Three rows, the top, middle and bottom, then left, center, right.
